      <li>Fault tolerance with lineage graphs.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="question">5. What is the difference between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset?</div>
  <div class="answer">RDD is the basic low-level API representing distributed collections. DataFrame is a distributed collection organized into named columns, with optimizations and schema. Dataset is a typed extension of DataFrames, combining benefits of RDDs and DataFrames with compile-time type safety (in Scala and Java only).</div>

  <div class="question">6. What is SparkContext?</div>
  <div class="answer">SparkContext is the entry point to Spark functionality, responsible for connecting to the cluster manager and coordinating job execution.</div>

  <div class="question">7. What is lazy evaluation in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Lazy evaluation means Spark postpones computation until an action is invoked, optimizing the overall data processing workflow.</div>

  <div class="question">8. What are transformations and actions in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Transformations are operations on RDDs that return new RDDs (lazy). Actions trigger execution and return results or write data.</div>

  <div class="question">9. How does Spark handle fault tolerance?</div>
  <div class="answer">Spark uses lineage information to recompute lost data partitions from parent RDDs in case of node failures.</div>

  <div class="question">10. What is the difference between cache() and persist()?</div>
  <div class="answer">cache() is a shorthand for persist() with the default storage level (memory only). persist() allows specifying storage levels like MEMORY_AND_DISK.</div>

  <div class="question">11. What is a broadcast variable?</div>
  <div class="answer">A broadcast variable allows the program to efficiently send a large read-only value to all worker nodes.</div>

  <div class="question">12. What is an accumulator?</div>
  <div class="answer">An accumulator is a variable that tasks can add to using commutative and associative operations, used for counters and sums.</div>

  <div class="question">13. What is Spark SQL?</div>
  <div class="answer">Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing using DataFrames and SQL queries.</div>

  <div class="question">14. What is a DataFrame?</div>

  <div class="question">15. How do you create a DataFrame in PySpark?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can create a DataFrame by loading data from external sources (like JSON, CSV, Parquet) or by converting an existing RDD or Python list using sparkSession.createDataFrame().</div>

  <div class="question">16. What are the common file formats supported by Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, Avro, and text files are commonly supported.</div>

  <div class="question">17. What is the difference between narrow and wide transformations?</div>
  <div class="answer">Narrow transformations (like map, filter) do not require data shuffling, while wide transformations (like reduceByKey, join) require shuffling data across partitions.</div>

  <div class="question">18. What is a shuffle operation in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Shuffle is a costly operation where data is redistributed across partitions, usually happening in wide transformations.</div>

  <div class="question">19. What is DAG in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is Spark’s execution plan representing sequence and dependencies of transformations.</div>

  <div class="question">20. Explain Spark Streaming.</div>
  <div class="answer">Spark Streaming processes live data streams by dividing data into micro-batches for near real-time analytics.</div>

  <div class="question">21. How to handle skewness in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Use salting keys, broadcast joins, or repartition to handle skewed data.</div>

  <div class="question">22. What is Tungsten in Spark?</div>

  <div class="question">24. What is the difference between coalesce() and repartition()?</div>
  <div class="answer">coalesce() reduces the number of partitions without shuffle (efficient for decreasing partitions), while repartition() can increase or decrease partitions and does shuffle.</div>

  <div class="question">25. What is a checkpoint in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Checkpointing saves the RDD to reliable storage to truncate lineage and recover data in case of failures.</div>

  <div class="question">26. Explain the role of Spark driver and executor.</div>
  <div class="answer">The driver program manages the SparkContext and plans jobs. Executors run tasks and perform computations on worker nodes.</div>

  <div class="question">27. How do you optimize joins in Spark?</div>
  <div class="answer">Use broadcast joins for small tables, partition data properly, and avoid skew by salting keys.</div>

  <div class="question">28. What is a SparkSession?</div>
